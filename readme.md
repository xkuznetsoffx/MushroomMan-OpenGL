# OpenGL coursework

Coursework for the 5th semester in Computer graphics in OpenGL

This project is a small game (+ graphics engine functionality) in the genre of “mushroom man”, in which you need to move around and pick up objects.

If you install this project, you will also need to download the following additional libraries: glfw, glew, glm and soil2. This can be done through the nuget package manager.
